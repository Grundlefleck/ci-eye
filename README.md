What is it?
-----------
CI-Eye is a **Build Radiator** that provides a clear visualisation of your continuous integration system.

Key Features
------------

* **runs anywhere** -- all you need is Java and a web browser
* **no installation** -- packaged as a single executable JAR
* **no plug-ins** -- talks to CI servers using their REST APIs, so no faff (and no permission) required
* **simple to set up** -- configured with a couple of text files
* **multi-purpose** -- talks to Hudson, Jenkins, and TeamCity at present, with plans to include other favourites
* **pictures everywhere** -- identifies who checked in, and shows their ugly mug
* **aggregates information** -- can combine build data from multiple sources into a single radiator view
* **mark-as-fixed** -- desktop UI allows users to interact with the radiator, marking broken builds as fixed
* **super D'oh mode** -- if you screwed up the world, flag a d'oh moment to let everyone know not to worry
* **buffers CI access** -- a single CI-Eye instance supports multiple radiators, so your CI servers aren't hammered
