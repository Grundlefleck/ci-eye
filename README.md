About
-----
CI-Eye is a Continuous Integration build radiator that talks to many different CI servers through their public APIs, allowing for a single consolidated view regardless of your CI infrastructure.

CI-Eye talks to Hudson, Jenkins, and TeamCity at present, with plans for expansion to include other favourites.

CI-Eye runs as a standalone web application, providing a buffer between the radiator clients and CI.

CI-Eye requires no installation and almost no setup.
